🌍 HABITABILITY

🚀 Overview

The Habitability Explorer is an interactive web app that uses NASA’s Exoplanet Archive data to calculate and visualize how potentially habitable a planet is.

Search for any exoplanet, view its habitability score, see how it compares to Earth, and explore Top 10 lists — from the most habitable to the hottest planets in our galaxy.


🧠 Why We Built This

Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered — but most people never get to see what they mean.
We wanted to translate NASA’s data into curiosity, giving anyone the chance to ask:

> “If not Earth… where else could we belong?”


⚙ Features

🌌 Planet Search — Type a planet name and instantly see its details.
📊 Habitability Score — A circular indicator that shows livability potential in %.
🚫 Red Flags — Automatic warnings for unlivable conditions (too hot, gas giant, etc.).
🌍 Earth Comparison — Every planet’s stats side-by-side with Earth’s.
🏆 Top 10 Lists — Explore the most habitable, hottest, and largest planets.
🔭 Data-Driven Insights — Based on NASA’s real exoplanet data.

🛠 Tech Stack

Layer	Technology

Backend	Python (Flask)
Frontend	HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Data	NASA Exoplanet Archive (JSON format)
Hosting	Replit / GitHub Pages (depending on setup)

🧩 How It Works

1. Backend (Flask) — Loads exoplanet data, normalizes it, and computes habitability scores.


2. APIs — /api/search, /api/top, and /api/all serve data dynamically to the frontend.


3. Frontend (JS) — Fetches JSON data and visually displays planet stats and scores.
